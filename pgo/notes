To collect/refresh PGO data:

1. Build Release_PGOGEN.  This would do two things:
	- Create instrumented rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin.dll and place it in game plugins folder.
	- Overwrite pgo\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin_saved.pgd with the new .pgd.  Do not check this one in yet, until step 5 is complete.
2. Place pgort120.dll next to instrumented rFactor2.exe
3. Run the game
4. Copy rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin![N].pgc back to pgo folder
5. Build Realease_AVX2.  This will:
	- produce merged pgo\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin.pgd
	- Overwrite pgo\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin_saved.pgd with the new merged .pgd.
6. Check in the newly merged .pgd
