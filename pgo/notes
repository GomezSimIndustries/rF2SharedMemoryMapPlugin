To collect/refresh PGO data:

1. Build Release_PGOGEN[_MT].  This would do two things:
	- Build instrumented rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin.dll.  Build will place it in the game plugins folder.
	- Build will Overwrite pgo\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin_saved[_mt].pgd with the new .pgd.  Do not check this one in yet, until step 5 is complete.
2. Place pgort120.dll next to rFactor2.exe
3. Run the game
4. Copy rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin![N].pgc from the rF2 Bin64\Plugins folder back to the pgo folder
5. Build Realease_AVX2[_MT].  This will:
	- Produce merged pgo\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin.pgd
	- Overwrite pgo\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin_saved[_mt].pgd with the new merged .pgd.
	- Produce and place PGO optimized plugin.
6. Check in the newly merged .pgd
